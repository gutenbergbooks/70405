<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Architecturally</span> speaking, we live
at a time somewhat similar to that in
which the genius of Piranesi first made
its impact upon English designers. In the
latter half of the eighteenth century English
architects and patrons were alike growing a
little tired of pure Palladianism. The novelty
and spirit of Inigo Jones’s work had given place
to the uninspired correctness of Campbell,
Kent, and a host of lesser disciples. Restrained
and elegant as the work of those
architects appears to modern eyes, after the
debauch of “free Classic” from which we
are now emerging, it is nevertheless true
that, at that time, the English Palladian
formula was nearly exhausted. The circuses
and crescents of Bath, with their unfluted
columns and dull ornament, their endless repetitions
of correct features, could not be
indefinitely extended. The early Georgian
houses, so comfortable in the country, began
to look a little coarse and provincial in London
streets, particularly to those who had taken
the Grand Tour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span></p>

<p>What more natural, then, that architects
should turn again to the source and fountainhead
from which Palladio had drawn his
inspiration, to see whether it had anything
fresh to yield?</p>

<p>The practising architect in England at
the end of the eighteenth century required,
however, a cicerone to the remains of the
antique world just as much as his predecessor
did in the seventeenth century. The
seventeenth-century architect chose Palladio
as his guide; the architect in the latter part
of the eighteenth century chose Piranesi.
Naturally, the lesson taught was somewhat
different. The eighteenth-century architect
was much further advanced in scholarship.
Palladio gave the main proportions of the
Orders and the principles of composition.
He laid down definite rules and precepts suitable
to beginners. His was the first-year
work, to use a school simile. Piranesi takes
the scholars of the later years and initiates
them into all the mysteries of ornament and
stylistic character. Offering no pedantic rules,
he makes a direct appeal to the imagination
of his students. He reveals to them not only
the power but the intimate spirit of the
Roman world. He offers them whole collections
of vases and candelabra to use or not as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
they like. He unlocks a treasure-house—a
library full of fresh detail. The detail, too, is
rich, complex detail, safe only in the hands of
the discerning. But Piranesi’s students in
England at that time were fit to profit by such
a master; among his more attentive scholars
being Robert Adam, Chambers, Dance, and
many other architects of the late eighteenth
century, and through these he influenced the
decorative designers from Chippendale to
Pergolesi. Mr. Phene Spiers, not without a
certain hyperbole, traces the Empire Style to
Piranesi’s designs for chimneypieces. At
any rate it is safe to say that the new vigour
and life which came into English architecture
with the work of Chambers and Adam was
derived from a more thorough and complete
knowledge of Roman architecture, and that
the chief source of that knowledge was the
vast collection of thirteen hundred or more
engraved plates which Piranesi etched and
published at the marvellous rate of one a
fortnight throughout a fairly long life.</p>

<p>Now, if any coherence at all can be seen
in the trend of modern English architecture,
we seem at the present moment to be just as
dissatisfied with mere Palladianism as were
the architects of the end of the eighteenth
century. Like them, too, we are looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
for a more complete expression of the
Classic spirit. To us, therefore, Piranesi may
have a very similar lesson. The unfortunate
thing, however, is that his etchings, a few
years ago so easy to obtain, are daily becoming
more rare and expensive. A collection
of the best of those issued during the artist’s
lifetime could hardly be made to-day for less
than a couple of hundred pounds. The Paris
reprints which his son issued in 1815 might be
obtained for half that sum, but to the ordinary
practitioner this may be considered as half
infinity. Even Mr. Keith Young’s massive
volume of reproductions costs several pounds.
The days of Robert Adam were the days
when architects were few and patrons were
rich. Our own times are less happy in
that respect, but they are nevertheless the
days of unrivalled opportunity. Piranesi is
the magician who can show what opportunities
may become; more especially as the process
block, albeit lacking in the marvellous gradations
of tone and feeling of the original etchings,
renders it possible to publish at small cost such
a series as are comprised in this volume.</p>

<p>The following are the main facts of
Piranesi’s career as far as they are <span class="locked">known:—</span></p>

<p>Giovanni Battista Piranesi, to give him
his full name, was born in Venice in the year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
1720. His father Angelo pursued the honourable
calling of a stonemason, so suited to the
progenitor of an architect. His mother was
sister to an engineer and architect named
Lucchesi, and it was to him that young
Piranesi was articled. In his early years he
seems to have been something of an <i lang="fr">enfant
prodigue</i> and is reported to have been able to
draw the architecture of Venice at the age of
eight. At eighteen he persuaded his parents
to send him to Rome, and ever after, although
signing himself “Venetian Architect,” he remained
at work in that city. At first, in his
desire to obtain a firm grasp on the technique
of the graphic arts, he seems to have attached
himself to various masters. The story is told
that he threatened one of these masters, Vasi,
with the loss of his life because he imagined
that some secret in the process of etching
was being withheld from him. Such a story,
whether true or not, together with the later
one that he saw for the first time and married
his wife within the space of one week, fits in
well enough with the impetuous temperament
and fine fury of work which all the etchings
exhibit. The numerous controversies in
which he was engaged in later years, sometimes
involving the erasure of names from
dedication and title-pages, are all evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
of the same characteristics—characteristics
which may have made him, according to
modern standards, a poor archæologist, but
which were not without value to the artist
and teacher of artists.</p>

<p>In 1741, when twenty-one years of age,
Piranesi published his first etchings, four compositions
of ruins, afterwards included in his
<i lang="it">Opere Varie</i>, issued by Bouchard at Rome in 1750.
In 1748 he published his <i lang="it">Antichità Romane de’
Tempi della Repubblica e de’ primi Imperatori, etc.</i>,
containing thirty plates of triumphal arches,
amphitheatres, and other ancient structures,
mostly from places other than Rome. The
price of this volume (Mr. Samuel informs us
in his admirable book) was 16 paoli, or about
13s. 4d., which shows for how small a contemporary
reward Piranesi had to work. In
1750 Bouchard published his <i lang="it">Opere Varie</i>,
which contained a number of his imaginative
designs for great halls, staircases and monuments,
as well as his famous series of prison
dreams—the <i lang="it">Carceri d’Invenzione</i>. From this
time onwards followed in quick succession an
immense number of etchings grouped somewhat
irregularly in great folio volumes with
varying engraved title-pages. The <i lang="it">Raccolta di
Varie Vedute</i> (Rome 1751) contains ninety-three
small views and includes work by Israel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
Silvestre and other etchers. This volume
must not be confused with the <i lang="it">Vedute di Roma</i>,
in two volumes, containing large title-pages and
one hundred and thirty-seven plates, thirty-four
of which were published in 1751, under the
title <i lang="it">Le Magnificenze di Roma le più remarcabili</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps Piranesi’s greatest work, in both
size and importance, is <i lang="it">Le Antichità Romane</i>,
in four volumes, containing a varying number
of plates from 216–224. This was first issued
in 1756.</p>

<p>In 1761, he etched four plates for Robert
Adam illustrating the latter’s design for Sion
House, and in 1769 he published his <i lang="it">Diverse
Maniere d’Adornare</i>, in which appear the
ornate but very stimulating designs for
chimneypieces, referred to above. Of his
remaining works, perhaps the most important
to architects is the <i lang="it">Vasi Candelabri Cippi Sarcofagi
Tripodi Lucerne ed ornamenti Antichi</i>, to give
it its full title, which was published in Rome
in 1778—the year of his death. This contains
a series of magnificent drawings of antiques,
largely from his own collection. A great
number of these drawings are dedicated to
various English gentlemen, each described as
“a lover of the fine arts,” which is proof of
the interest Englishmen were already taking
in Piranesi and his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span></p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, Piranesi
published a number of monographs on special
subjects illustrated with etchings. Among
these are the volumes on Trajan’s Column,
the Theatre at Herculaneum, Hadrian’s Villa,
and the Temples at Pæstum, all of which are
more noticeable for the boldness of the
draughtsmanship than for the archæological
views they set forth. It must not be
imagined, however, because Piranesi was the
interpreter of the romance of the Roman
ruins, and through this very romance fired the
imagination of Europe, that he was not when
he liked an exact draughtsman. The cracks
on the obelisk shown in the foreground of his
etching of Santa Maria Maggiore tally with
those shown in a photograph taken one
hundred and fifty years later.</p>

<p>In April, 1757, Piranesi was elected an
honorary Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries,
which is another proof of the esteem in which
he was held in England. He was knighted
by Pope Clement XIII. in 1767. He died in
1778, and is buried in the church of Santa
Maria Aventina.</p>

<p>Of his five children, Francesco (b. 1748)
and Laura (b. 1750) etched in their father’s
manner and assisted him in his work. After
his death, however, they took to print-selling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
rather than creative work, though Francesco
still etched plates on his own account. In 1798
he packed up his father’s copper-plates and
took them to Paris. During an adventurous
journey they fell into the hands of an
English Admiral, who, however, knowing
the fame of the father, unfortunately restrained
his first impulse to throw the plates overboard.
It was unfortunate because on arrival
in Paris Francesco was able, with the help of
the French Government, to republish from
the old plates a new edition of his father’s
work, which, from the state of the plates,
for many years did considerable damage to
Piranesi’s fame as an etcher. The plates
exist at the present day, and it is believed
that prints are still occasionally struck from
them. Now, however, the difference between
the original Roman impressions and the later
Paris ones is well understood, and Piranesi’s
renown never stood higher than it does
to-day. His son died in 1810.</p>

<p>The plates here reproduced are from the
author’s collection, with the exception of the
designs for chimneypieces, which have been
kindly lent by Mr. Batsford.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> presenting this list the Publishers would draw
attention to the distinctive character of the works
which are described. These cover a wide field, being of
interest not only to those who are professionally concerned
with architecture and building, but also to those
who have a general non-technical interest in such
subjects. Thus, the volume giving an illustrated historical
survey of Mediæval and Renaissance architecture in
England, and the volumes dealing with English domestic
and ecclesiastical architecture, garden city houses, and
domestic interior details, appeal alike to the educated
layman and to the architect in practice.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Practical Exemplar of Architecture</span>” and
“<span class="smcap">Standard Details</span>,” though also of strictly professional
interest, are of totally different character, giving,
as they do, carefully measured drawings and photographs
of some of the finest examples of architecture in the
kingdom; while those who are specially concerned with
architectural education from the standpoint of design
will find in “<span class="smcap">The Liverpool Sketch Book</span>” a notable
collection of students’ drawings.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Who’s Who in Architecture</span>” should be warmly
welcomed as a work occupying a mid-position between
the biography and the directory. As its name implies, it
gives biographical particulars of all the leading men in
the profession, and furnishes as well a complete list of
architects in practice.</p>

<p>In addition, particulars are given of “<span class="smcap">The Architects’
and Builders’ Journal</span>”—the most up-to-date, the
best illustrated, and most widely read of the architectural
and building weeklies—and “<span class="smcap">The Architectural
Review</span>,” which, in its new form, has achieved the
distinction of being the finest of all current publications
devoted to the art of architecture.</p>

Thus, in Section I. we survey the work of the cathedral
builders; in Section II. notable examples of the Early

Later Renaissance, and a few examples that carry us
into the nineteenth century; the survey concluding with
a fine series of illustrations of work by Sir Aston Webb,
Mr. Ernest Newton, Mr. Mervyn Macartney, and other
eminent architects of the present day.</p>

<p>The letterpress accompanying the illustrations is written
by acknowledged authorities, and sets forth in brief order

</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“The Architectural Review,”</span> in the new
and enlarged form in which it is now published, is
acknowledged to be the finest of all periodicals devoted
to the art of architecture. The superb series of large
plates which are a feature of every issue are sufficient
alone to warrant the generous praise which the “<span class="smcap">Review</span>”
has received from all quarters. The illustrations are,
indeed, a most striking feature of the “<span class="smcap">Review</span>,” but there
is also the literary side of the magazine to be taken into
account, the articles which appear in its pages being written
by acknowledged authorities.</p>

<p>In recent years the scope of the “<span class="smcap">Review</span>” has been
largely extended, so that in its present form it appeals to
the educated section of the general public, as well as to the
professional architect.</p>

<p>One has only to glance at the issues which have appeared
during the past year in order to appreciate what a wide
range of interesting subjects are dealt with. The finely
illustrated articles on London Clubs, Georgian interior
decoration, large country houses like Sutton Place and
Broughton Castle, the etchings of Méryon, Frank Brangwyn,
&amp;c., afford ample indication of the general attractiveness
of the contents.</p>

<p>Garden design, too, is well represented, beautiful examples
being illustrated by means of photographs reproduced to a
large size.</p>

Interior Details.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Garden</span> suburbs, or suburbs developed on lines that
are far more rural than is possible in the centre of a
town, have sprung up all over the country, and the architect
has been confronted with a new task—the task of designing
a small house which can be erected at moderate cost, but
which, nevertheless, provides accommodation in keeping
with the demands of modern life.</p>

<p>It is of great value to have an illustrated survey of the most
noteworthy houses that have been erected. The present
volume gives such a survey, in the form of special photographs
reproduced to a good size, showing the actual
appearance of the houses, accompanied in every case by
carefully drawn plans. The examples include work by all
the leading architects who have devoted special attention to
the problem of the small house, and their solutions are
presented in the most attractive form.</p>

<p>Such illustrations alone would make the book an extremely
useful one, but when to them is added a fine collection of
domestic interior details, the value of the book becomes
greatly enhanced. These details are of an essentially
practical character, showing in a complete manner the
design and construction of such features as chimneypieces,
panelling, dressers, servery, and store-room fittings, &amp;c. A
typical specification of a garden city house is also given,
accompanied by working drawings.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">English</span> houses have so long established themselves
in the forefront of domestic architecture
that the distinctive qualities which they exhibit need
not be enlarged upon; no houses excel them for quiet
dignity, appropriate treatment, and charm of effect.</p>

<p>English architects have enjoyed a unique legacy in the
mansions of the Tudor and Renaissance periods, and
the delightful character of these examples has been
a never-failing inspiration for modern work.</p>

<p>Of great interest and value, therefore, are these volumes
dealing with recent examples of English Domestic
Architecture, by architects whose ability in this branch
of work is acknowledged and admired. Great care has
been exercised in the selection of the examples, which
are illustrated by means of photographs reproduced to a
large size, and accompanied by plans and descriptive
particulars.</p>

<p>While being of interest equally to the layman as to
the architect in practice, the volumes are no mere
picture-books, but substantial contributions to the
subject of English Domestic Architecture. They are
very complete in their scope, embracing not only
general exterior and interior views, but also details of
decorative work in the houses illustrated. Garden
design, too, has received adequate attention.</p>

are engaged in the practical application of exact
draughtsmanship to architectural design. It is essential
that the draughtsman should be able to set out “The
Orders” in a rapid and precise manner, and such facility
can only be acquired by familiarity with the best
methods of setting up drawings. It is the special object
of this volume to show these methods.</p>

<p>The plates are not confined to “The Orders” proper,
but embrace their application to windows, doorways,
arcading, niches, &amp;c., and include also a number of
large illustrations of domes, staircases, and other constructional
features, as well as plates illustrating the
best methods of setting up perspectives and the projection
of shadows.</p>

it is necessary to encompass the resources of

By these means a pictorial record is obtained showing
all the effects of light and shade, of tone and texture, of
weathering and exposure, which make up the total effect
of the original, and at the same time there are ready to
hand drawings which show the design in elevation, plan,

construction which are not comprehended in the casual
glance.</p>

<p>The drawings, specially prepared for this publication, are
themselves admirable examples of accurate, clear, and

E. Macartney, B.A., F.S.A., F.R.I.B.A., as possessing
merits of design and execution which are worthy of

of chimneypieces, gates, panelling, doorways, ironwork,

<span class="allsmcap">M.A., F.R.I.B.A.</span>, has become closely identified with the
modern movement for the development of classical
design and the careful study of monumental work. It is
conducted on the most scholarly lines, embodying the
best methods of the French and American schools, and
the results achieved have been approved by all the
leading men of the profession.</p>

<p>The illustrations in “<span class="smcap">The Sketch Book</span>” are beautifully
printed on thick art paper, and the volumes will be
found particularly interesting and useful to all students.
In view of the fact that for the Final Examination of the
R.I.B.A. four testimonies of study are now required, the
designs and details illustrated in these volumes, which
show how similar problems have been dealt with, should
be found of the greatest possible value.</p>

<p>In addition to work by present students of the School,
and the work of the Travelling Scholars, that of its old
students, and others connected with it directly or only
sympathetically, is also included, the object being to
present a consistent and definite architectural outlook
rather than a mere collection of drawings.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> new volume, which makes its first appearance
in 1914, will take its place henceforth as
a work of reference for everyone connected with
architecture and building. Perhaps its greatest attraction
lies in the fact that it occupies a sort of midway
position between the biography and the directory,
possessing all the personal interest of the one and all
the detailed information of the other. The societies
have their list of members, and the directories give,
more or less correctly, the names and addresses of
architects in practice, but the information thus presented
is of the baldest description, and quite devoid
of all personal attraction. “<span class="smcap">Who’s Who in Architecture</span>”
is of far greater interest and value. It gives
a succinct account of all the most notable men in the
profession—their training, achievements, etc.—and not
only of the leading men, but also of the many architects
who have done important work without having
had the attention of the profession directed to it. The
book also gives addresses, etc., and as the list of
architects is a thoroughly comprehensive one, “<span class="smcap">Who’s
Who in Architecture</span>” thus fulfils a dual purpose
<span class="locked">as—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot hang2">

<p>(1) A personal record of members of the profession,
and</p>

<p>(2) A list of architects practising in the United
Kingdom.</p>
</div>

<p>Hence it is a volume which every architect needs to
have on his shelf.</p>

</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Buildings</span> that have been the scene of historical
events, or have played a distinctive part in the
development of national life, are commonly dealt with
either at length in a most unattractive style, or dismissed
in a few sentences embodying dates and particulars
which are frequently inaccurate. Thus, the general
reader finds himself confronted with two extremes,
alike unsatisfactory. It was with the express object of
correcting these deficiencies in respect of certain famous
buildings that the authors compiled the series of short
papers which constitute the volume under notice. They
have been at great pains in their task, and, as the result
of much original research, a flood of fresh light is
thrown upon the subjects dealt with, every chapter
adding some new fact to previous knowledge, or reproducing
some hitherto unknown or neglected plan. In
this way we have set before us, by means of description
and illustration, the most remarkable of all Henry VIII.’s
palaces—Nonsuch, in Surrey, whose wanton destruction
was probably the heaviest loss which English architecture
has suffered since the Dissolution of the Monasteries.</p>

<p>The Tower of London, dealt with in another chapter,
offers a wealth of interest when critical research and
architectural acumen are brought into play, and in the
same way the Royal Palace of Eltham, Northumberland
House, Sir Thomas More’s House at Chelsea, the Fortune
Theatre, Barking Abbey, and other famous buildings are
dealt with.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
